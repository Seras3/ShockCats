Sockets learning process.

What I've learned :
  - How to work with sockets (using [socket.io](https://socket.io/))
    * namespaces (even dynamic created)
    * rooms
    * emit / broadcast
  - How to set up a cloud connection with [Atlas MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) 
    * always look for your IP on whitelist before connect to DB

## PS: 
Last version is based on local storage (without cloud storage).
For db storage here is the [last commit](https://github.com/Seras3/ShockCats/commit/f0d949119e047bed0df6d030676249a758e9b6a9).
